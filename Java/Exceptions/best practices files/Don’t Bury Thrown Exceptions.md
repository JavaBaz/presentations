# Why You Shouldn’t Bury Exceptions



## Why Burying Exceptions is Bad:

```java
try {
    riskyOperation();
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Ignoring the exception
}
```

- No action is taken, no logs are recorded, and the exception’s details are lost.
- Debugging will be difficult if something goes wrong.



## Key Reasons:

### Lack of Visibility:
- If you catch an exception and do nothing, you lose critical information about the error, such as its cause, location, and context.
- This makes diagnosing and fixing the problem almost impossible.

### Debugging Becomes Harder:
- Without a trace of the exception in logs or error messages, developers have no clue where or why the issue occurred, leading to wasted time and frustration.

### Unexpected Behavior:
- Ignoring exceptions can leave your application in an inconsistent or unstable state because it may continue running as if nothing went wrong.

### Poor Maintenance:
- Burying exceptions creates technical debt, as future maintainers of the code won't have the necessary information to understand or address problems.

## What to Do Instead:

### Log the Exception:
- If the exception doesn't need immediate handling, at least log its details (e.g., type, message, stack trace) so developers can investigate later.

```java
try {
    riskyOperation();
} catch (Exception e) {
    log.error("Exception occurred: " + e.getMessage(), e);
}
```

### Handle the Exception Appropriately:
- If the exception can be resolved, handle it in the `catch` block.

```java
try {
    connection.open();
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println("Failed to open connection: " + e.getMessage());
    retryConnection();
}

```

### Rethrow the Exception:
- If the current method can’t handle the exception, rethrow it to let higher levels deal with it.

```java
try {
    parseFile(filePath);
} catch (ParseException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing file: " + filePath, e);
}

```

### Use Exception Wrapping:
- Wrap the exception with additional context if needed, while preserving the original exception.

```java
try {
    executeTask();
} catch (SQLException e) {
    throw new DataAccessException("Error executing database task", e);
}
```

## Takeaway:

Never bury exceptions. Always take one of these actions:
- Log it to retain error details.
- Handle it to recover from the issue.
- Rethrow it if it’s not your method’s responsibility to fix it.

This ensures visibility, simplifies debugging, and maintains the stability of your application.
