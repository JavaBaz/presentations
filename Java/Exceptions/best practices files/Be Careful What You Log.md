# Why You Must Be Careful

## Security Risks:
- Logs can be stored in systems with varying levels of protection, such as low-cost storage solutions, which might not have robust security measures.
- If sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identifiers) is logged, it becomes vulnerable to unauthorized access or breaches.

## Privacy Compliance:
- Many jurisdictions have strict laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) governing how personal data is stored, processed, and accessed.
- Logging protected data, even unintentionally, could put your company out of compliance, leading to fines, lawsuits, or reputational damage.

## Risk to Your Career:
- Logging sensitive data carelessly could be seen as a professional lapse, especially if it causes harm or a data breach. This could lead to serious repercussions for you as a developer.



## What Not to Log:

### Protected Data:
- Passwords
- API keys or authentication tokens
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like Social Security Numbers (SSNs), names, addresses, or phone numbers
- Financial information like credit card or bank account numbers

### Internal System Details:
- Stack traces in production logs (can reveal internal workings of your system)
- System environment variables or configurations that might include credentials




## Best Practices for Secure Logging:

### Sanitize Logged Data:
- Mask sensitive data before logging it.
- **Example:** Instead of logging a full credit card number, log only the last four digits.
```java
log.info("Processing payment for card ending in ****5678");
```

### Use Logging Libraries with Filtering:
- Many logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J) support filters to exclude sensitive data. Use these features to prevent sensitive information from being logged.

### Log at Appropriate Levels:
- Avoid excessive logging, especially at the DEBUG level, in production environments.
- Use `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR` levels judiciously to log only what is necessary for operational monitoring and debugging.

### Encrypt Logs:
- If logs must contain sensitive data for any reason (e.g., regulatory audits), ensure they are encrypted to protect against unauthorized access.
