# Why Keep Exception Handling Separate?

## Key Benefits:

- **Improves Code Readability:**
    - Mixing exception handling with the main logic clutters the code and makes it harder to follow.
    - Keeping the main logic focused on its task ensures your code remains clear and concise.

- **Easier Maintenance:**
    - If exception handling is isolated, you can modify or improve error handling without affecting the main logic.
    - Debugging becomes simpler since error-handling code is in predictable locations.

- **Encourages Reusability:**
    - By centralizing exception handling, you can avoid duplicating the same error-handling code in multiple places.
    - Common exception handling strategies (e.g., logging) can be implemented once and reused.

## How to Achieve This?

1. **Use try-catch Blocks Wisely:**  
   Place try-catch blocks around specific operations prone to exceptions, not around entire methods or unrelated logic.
   
### Example (bad)
```java
try {
    // Main logic
    readFile();
    processFileData();
    saveResults();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handles all exceptions
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
   ### Example (better)
```java
try {
    readFile();
} catch (IOException e) {
    handleIOException(e);
}

processFileData();
saveResults();
```

2. **Use Helper Methods for Exception Handling:**  
   Encapsulate error-handling logic in separate methods.
```java
public void handleIOException(IOException e) {
    // Centralized logic: log the error or take appropriate action
    System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

3. **Centralized Exception Handling (if applicable):**  
   For larger applications, use a global or centralized error-handling mechanism (e.g., in a web app, an error handler at the controller or middleware level).

## Benefits of Separating Exception Handling:

- **Clarity:** Main logic focuses on the task; error handling is distinct.
- **Flexibility:** Easily adapt to new error-handling requirements.
- **Modularity:** Makes debugging and updating specific parts of the code easier.

By keeping exception handling separate, you ensure your application is both easier to understand and maintain over time.
