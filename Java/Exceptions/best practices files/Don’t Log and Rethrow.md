# Why Avoid Logging and Rethrowing?

## Key Issues:

### Duplicate Log Entries:
- When you log an exception and then rethrow it, the same exception will likely be logged multiple times—once where it was caught and again when it's handled at a higher level.
- This clutters log files and makes it harder to determine where the error was first encountered.

### Code Duplication:
- Logging and rethrowing the same exception often duplicates the information and bloats your code unnecessarily.

### Confusing Stack Traces:
- When the same exception is logged multiple times, it can create confusion about where the error occurred and how it propagated through the application.

### Separation of Concerns:
- Low-level code (where the exception is caught) may not have the full context to decide how an exception should be logged or handled. It’s better to let the higher-level method handle it.


## What to Do Instead

### Option 1: Log and Continue
- If you handle the exception locally and do not need to propagate it further, log the exception and continue with your application logic.

```java
try {
    Class.forName("com.mcnz.Example");
} catch (ClassNotFoundException ex) {
    log.warning("Class was not found: " + ex.getMessage());
    // Take corrective action or continue
}
```

### Option 2: Rethrow Without Logging
- If the current method cannot handle the exception properly, rethrow it and let a higher-level method handle logging and recovery.

```java
try {
    Class.forName("com.mcnz.Example");
} catch (ClassNotFoundException ex) {
    throw ex; // Let the calling method decide how to log or handle
}
```

### Option 3: Wrap and Rethrow (With Context)
- If you need to add additional context to the exception, wrap it in a custom or higher-level exception and rethrow it. The higher-level exception can then be logged at a later point.

```java
try {
    Class.forName("com.mcnz.Example");
} catch (ClassNotFoundException ex) {
    throw new MyCustomException("Failed to load required class", ex);
}
```


## When to Log and When to Rethrow

### Log Locally:
- If you can handle the exception completely (e.g., logging an error and taking corrective action), log it locally and do not rethrow.

### Rethrow Without Logging:
- If you cannot handle the exception, rethrow it and let the caller (or a centralized handler) log it.

### Centralized Logging:
- For large applications, use a centralized exception handler (e.g., a global exception handler in a web app) to log exceptions consistently and avoid duplication.

## Key Takeaways:
- **Choose one:** Either log the exception or rethrow it, but not both.
- **Avoid clutter:** Prevent duplicate log entries to keep logs clean and meaningful.
- **Separate concerns:** Let higher-level methods decide how and where to log exceptions when rethrowing them.

By following this guideline, you ensure that logs remain concise, readable, and useful for troubleshooting.
