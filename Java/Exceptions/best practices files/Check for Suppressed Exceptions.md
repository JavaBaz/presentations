# Explanation: Check for Suppressed Exceptions

Suppressed exceptions are a feature introduced in Java 7 with `try-with-resources`. They occur when an exception is thrown while a resource is being closed in a `try-with-resources` block, in addition to a primary exception already being thrown from the main body of the `try` block.

Checking for suppressed exceptions ensures you don’t miss critical information about what went wrong during resource cleanup.

## How Suppressed Exceptions Work

When using `try-with-resources`, resources (like files, streams, or connections) are automatically closed when the block exits. If the resource's `close()` method throws an exception while another exception is already being thrown from the `try` block, the closing exception is suppressed to avoid overwriting the primary exception. These suppressed exceptions are stored inside the primary exception and can be accessed using the `getSuppressed()` method.

## Why Check for Suppressed Exceptions?

### Detect Hidden Problems:
- If you don’t check for suppressed exceptions, you might miss important errors that occurred during resource cleanup (e.g., failing to close a database connection).

### Debugging Insights:
- Suppressed exceptions often reveal additional context about the issue, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple resources.

### Comprehensive Error Handling:
- Ignoring suppressed exceptions may result in incomplete error handling and leave unresolved issues in your application.

## Example: Primary and Suppressed Exceptions

### Code Example:

```java
class Door implements AutoCloseable {
    public void swing() throws SwingException {
        throw new SwingException("Door swinging failed");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() throws CloseException {
        throw new CloseException("Door closing failed");
    }
}

class SwingException extends Exception {
    public SwingException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

class CloseException extends Exception {
    public CloseException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class SuppressedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Door door = new Door()) {
            door.swing(); // This throws a SwingException
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Primary Exception: " + e.getMessage());
            for (Throwable suppressed : e.getSuppressed()) {
                System.out.println("Suppressed Exception: " + suppressed.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Output:

```plaintext
Primary Exception: Door swinging failed
Suppressed Exception: Door closing failed
```


## Best Practices for Handling Suppressed Exceptions

### Always Check for Suppressed Exceptions:
- When catching an exception, check if it has any suppressed exceptions using `getSuppressed()`. This ensures you don’t miss secondary errors.

###  Example
```java
try {
    // Code with resources
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Primary Exception: " + e);
    for (Throwable suppressed : e.getSuppressed()) {
        System.out.println("Suppressed Exception: " + suppressed);
    }
}
```

### Log Both Exceptions:
- Log the primary and suppressed exceptions separately to retain all debugging information.

### Design Resources to Minimize Exceptions in `close()`:
- Ensure that your `AutoCloseable` resources handle errors gracefully during cleanup to avoid generating suppressed exceptions unnecessarily.

### Use Suppressed Exceptions for Insights, Not Overrides:
- Do not override or discard suppressed exceptions; they provide crucial context about secondary failures.

## Key Takeaways:

- **What are suppressed exceptions?**  
  Exceptions that occur during resource cleanup in a `try-with-resources` block but are stored in the primary exception to preserve the original context.

- **Why check for them?**  
  To avoid missing secondary errors that might reveal critical problems during cleanup.

- **How to handle them?**  
  Use `getSuppressed()` to log or analyze them alongside the primary exception.

By consistently checking for suppressed exceptions, you ensure a thorough understanding of all errors in your application, leading to better debugging and more robust error handling.
