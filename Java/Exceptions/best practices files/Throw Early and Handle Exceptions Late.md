# Why Throw Exceptions Early?

## Immediate Response to Problems:
- If an error condition is detected, delaying the exception allows your program to execute additional code unnecessarily, potentially leading to incorrect or undefined behavior.
- Throwing an exception immediately stops further processing, ensuring that invalid states or actions are avoided.

## Easier Debugging:
- The exception stack trace points directly to where the error occurred.
- Delaying the exception might make it harder to pinpoint the root cause.

## Clean Separation of Concerns:
- Throwing an exception at the point of failure allows other parts of your application to decide how to handle it, rather than trying to recover in the same place.

# Why Handle Exceptions Late?

## Centralized Exception Handling:
- Catching exceptions at a higher level reduces the number of `try-catch` blocks scattered throughout your code, improving readability and maintainability.
- A centralized approach allows consistent handling, like logging or error reporting.

## Preserve the Stack Trace:
- Allowing an exception to propagate upward preserves its context, making debugging easier.
- Catching too early can obscure where the problem originated.

## Avoid Premature Handling:
- Sometimes a low-level method may not know how to handle an exception properly. Letting it propagate ensures it is handled by the layer with enough context to decide what to do.

# Key Points:

- **Throw Early:**  
  Detect problems immediately and throw exceptions to prevent invalid operations or undefined behavior.  
  **Example:** Validating method inputs at the start.

- **Handle Late:**  
  Catch exceptions at higher levels where you can decide the appropriate recovery actions.  
  Centralized handling reduces redundancy and improves code maintainability.

# Advantages:

## Improved Readability:
- Clear separation between error detection (throwing) and error handling (catching).

## Simplified Maintenance:
- Fewer scattered catch blocks mean easier code maintenance and consistency.

## Better Debugging:
- Preserved stack traces and centralized handling make root causes easier to trace.

By adhering to this principle, you create more robust, maintainable, and readable code.
