### Why use REST API?
<br>

1. **Securtiy**
By using REST API, we can seperate backend from what user actually can see (client) and we can handle securtiy concerns.
<br>

2. **Versatile**
By using REST API, we can have multiple clients (web, mobile app and etc.)
<br>

3. **Separation of concerns**
By using REST API, backend and clients are fully separated and can be modified without messing up with the whole system.
<br>

4. **Interoperability**
In REST API systems, each part of system can be made by different teams since there is Separation of concerns.
Backend team can expose certain endpoints to other teams and make it public so other teams can consume api and use it in order to develop their product without involving backend team.
